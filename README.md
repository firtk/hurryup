# Hurry Up!

This is a chrome extension that enables saving the current opened tabs and reopening them whenever you want, with options multiple windows support. 

**Why would you want to use this extension ?**

Chrome saves tabs when you close the browser but it clears them when you start the use chrome again and open new tabs. This extension prevents this situation.

## Installing

- On the chrome extensions page enable developer mode.

- Click "Load unpacked extension" then select unzipped folder.

## Usage

- Just click the extension icon when you want to save and exit opened tabs. When you want to reopen the tabs click the icon again. Icon will change its position according to save and load states.

- You can right click the extension icon and go to Options for multiple windows support. By default extension focuses only single window where does extension called. 

- There is one more option for when you bored searching something on the internet, you can specify the url that you want to open after closing tabs.
